#### Dates and quantities are the bare minimum requirements for collaboration, yet often surrounding information like financial terms, price, and logistics data is required to support decisions.
#### Processes beyond passing basic files and values like splitting date/quantities in the [[purchasing-shipping-receiving-invoicing]] cycle
#### Typical transactions:
##### Purchase Orders
##### Sales Orders
##### Shipments
##### RFQs and Quotes
##### Blanket orders and pulls
##### Scheduling agreements
##### Purchase Authorizations
##### Receipts
##### Invoices
##### Serial and Lot Numbers
